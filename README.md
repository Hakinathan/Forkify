# Forkify

To put into practice everything I learned in [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) from Jonas Schmedtmann, we created a recipe viewer. It's a project using an API made by Jonas that contains a whole list of recipes. The goal is to put into practice all the sections of the course. I.e. asynchronous code, classes, modules, ES functions and much more!

## Disclaimer !

This is a Javascript based course. I didn't realize the HTML, and CSS part of this project.

I recommend this course and the others by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).
